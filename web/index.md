## About this event

<div class="callout callout-success">

This informal meeting will bring together researchers interested in or working on topics connected to **integrated surface-subsurface hydrological modeling**. 

The meeting will be focused on a number of talks that will address current progress and challenges in coupled surface–subsurface hydrological modeling, solute transport modeling, data assimilation, and catchment hydrology at large. Plus, we’ll make sure plenty of time is left for open discussion.
